# âš¡ Quick Start (WIP)

## ðŸ›  How to Use SketchScript

There are a few ways to get started depending on your setup:

### 1. Use the Hosted Code Sandbox (Free or Paid) - WIP

### 2. Self-Host the Sandbox - WIP

---

## ðŸ§© Editor Tooling (Coming Soon)

Right now, you can only view and edit code in the sandbox. We're actively building extensions for:

- VS Code
- Neovim
- Emacs
- JetBrains (maybe)

Once those are ready, you'll be able to author and preview SketchScript inside your preferred editor.
