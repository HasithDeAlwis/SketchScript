## üì¢ Announcement
Due to high cloud costs, I've decided to take down the deployments of SketchScript, however, new docs will be up soon on how you can deploy it yourself. The idea is to just write one or two commands on your terminal and the deployments will happen instantaneously. Stay tuned üî•üöÄ

## [üé• DEMO ON MARKETTING WEBSITE](https://sketchscript.dev/)

## ‚ú® Features
SketchScript is a simple and expressive DSL written in Haskell that lets designers and developers build mockups with code. It allows you to write declarative layouts, preview them instantly, and even export to HTML ‚Äî all with version control and developer ergonomics in mind.

> Think of it as a programmable alternative to Balsamiq or Figma wireframes that is fully open source and built for teams that love code.

- **Code-driven mockups** using a minimal DSL
- **Live previews** via the SketchScript sandbox
- **HTML codegen** (with more targets coming)
- **Upcoming IDE extensions** for VS Code, Vim, Emacs, and more
- **Supports version control and CI integration**
- **Great for learning frontend layout fundamentals**
