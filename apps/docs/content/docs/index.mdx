# 🚀 Welcome to SketchScript

## ✨ Why SketchScript?

- ### 🧠 **Design-Driven Code**<br/>
  SketchScript lets you express UI layouts and structure through readable, functional code. Your wireframes now **live alongside your logic**, test cases, and docs — not locked in Figma or Balsamiq.

- ### ✍️ **Simple, Expressive Syntax** <br/>
  Designed to be minimal yet expressive. A few lines of code can describe full layouts.

- ### 🛠 **Tooling-First Experience**<br/>
  With **upcoming extensions for VS Code, Emacs, Vim, and Neovim**, SketchScript is built to slide right into your workflow.

- ### 📚 **A Living Source of Truth**<br/>
  Your mockups are now version-controlled, searchable, and part of your CI pipeline. No more “latest version” confusion or missing links in handoff — your **wireframes are code**.

- ### 🧩 **Learn Frontend Fundamentals**<br/>
  SketchScript introduces **box models, layout principles, and component thinking** in a gentle, declarative way — perfect for new designers who want to understand the frontend world.

- ### 💸 **Ditch Expensive Tools**<br/>
  Skip Balsamiq or other paywalled UI tools — SketchScript is free, open-source, and integrates directly into your stack.

> SketchScript is the perfect bridge between **design intent** and **production code**.
